# Ideas

- [ ] day 0
- [ ] how this blog is built
- [ ] airpods on linux with pipewire
- [ ] colored emojis in linux terminal
- [ ] should site has dark mode setting? (dark reader vs theming)
- [ ] sites should be so simple that you can read them without a browser
- [ ] world of ergonomic mechanical keyboards
- [ ] advent of code as a motivation to learn something new
- [ ] cookie consent is a joke
- [ ] terminal interfaces with haskell and brick
- [ ] liquidity vs corporate benefits
- [ ] new approach to building user interfaces (using Elm)
- [ ] NFT: fabulous technology vs reality
- [ ] 4-day work week (timezone magic)
- [ ] martian time standards
- [ ] monad is an interface that can bind and return
- [ ] the only bash shortcut you will ever need (^R)
- [ ] read oriented design (read, not write; listen, not talk) (MS Teams mic on by default and vim)
- [ ] tools should be a responsibility of the library/language developers
- [ ] 2022-02-22 magic dates of our lifetime
- [ ] social networks without community moderation are dangerous to society
- [ ] how LLMs are suppose to invent new information if they live in a sealed box
- [ ] programming language semantics/syntax we go by just because first compilers where not smart enough
    - semicolons
    - declare before use
    - excessive punctuaction
- [ ] why you should make your next game in HTML
    - game distribution is easy
    - immediately cross-platform with Electron/Tauri
    - you get the richest UI support
    - always online
    - JS performance is often not the bottleneck, and gets faster every day, and WASM is available for critical pieces
    - WebGL has on par performance with WebGL
- [ ] so you want to make a programming language
    - what it takes
    - realistic scope for one dev
    - ways to go around it
    - simple problems that look complicated and complicated problems that look similar
    - near impossible to get semantics right on the first try
- [ ] all of these are related in some way:
    - coroutines
    - generators (yield)
    - async/await
    - futures/promises
    - fibers
    - (Delimited, scoped) continuations
    - monads
    - algebraic effects
    what approach a language of the future should look at?
- [ ] kinds of tasks in programming
    - e.g. parsing, mapping, calculating in a loop, delegation, etc.
- [ ] inventions & discoveries of the human race
    - log time scale
- [ ] source code is your friend
    - code is the source of truth
    - don't be afraid to look at others code
    - technologies below you were made by smart people, all the way down
    - abstraction is for those who fear understanding the problem
    - most hard problems are solved, complexity is artificial
